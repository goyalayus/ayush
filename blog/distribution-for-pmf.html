                <p>Founders who have distribution have a real advantage but not in a way people think about it.</p>
                
                <p>As a founder your first Startup almost never works out, you try a dozen of ideas and maybe one works out.</p> 
                
                <p>But what do I mean by trying out an idea? It means building the product , reaching your neeche audience (100 people who absolutely love your product) taking feedback from these and finding product market fit (basically high rentention on product).</p>
                
                <p>Most founders struggle with founding these <em>100 people who have the potential to love your product</em> , for whom you were building your product.</p>
                
                <p>Now you can reach them in three ways :-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Manually</strong> - you cold email people, try to get intros, physical marketing.</li>
                    <li><strong>You burn investor money to buy distribution</strong> - paid sponsorships / adds.</li>
                    <li><strong>You have your own distribution</strong> - suppose you have 10k followers on Twitter. Now you can shitpost about your product and tell other people to repost your product post (10k followers gives you crediblity). also most people on twitter tech are early adopters. So your <em>speed to market</em> increases very much and you are able to do so many experiments and get to pmf fast.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>But this has a flaw, the flaw is suppose you were building a dev tool and your Twitter following came in massive help there but you did not get pmf, now you get an idea to start a construction software. None of your followers belongs to this space, now what do you do? Maybe you ask someone from construction space to repost your post and yeah I think this will work to atleast get some 100 people but you can't do this repeatatively not every post of yours your friend is gonna retweet.</p>
                
                <p>But this is even more complicated, for example you make content around college students who wanna startup. And your product is around corporate people who wanna startup then also you end up in the same problem. Retweets are easier in this case but still.</p>
                
                <p>the solution to this is I Think to become something like <a href="https://x.com/waitin4agi_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varun Mayya</a>. get to a million followers in youtube. then suppose you are building something for tier-1 city nurses for example, you just have to post a tweet/youtube post about rolling it out to early beta testers and boom you have a 1000 <em>niche</em> and <em>targeted users using your product</em>, much quicker feedback.</p>
